# harman is trying to learn how to do go in http

why? i just want to learn go and see what the hype is about.

I don't use golang in work, so I do golang in my free time.

# example 1

a simple hello (string based).

```
go run hello-world.go
curl localhost:8090/hello
```

```
go run hello-world.go
curl localhost:8090/json
{"message":"Hello World"}%
```
